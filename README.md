# Hashmap

Using the [TypeScript Node Starter Project](glenpike/typescript-node-starter)

Implementing a HashMap / Hash Table as a demonstration

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` in the root folder.

Start coding.

## Testing

Add / edit *_test.ts files in the `tests` directory and run `npm test` for a single pass.  Use `npm test -- --watchAll` to run jest in 'watch' mode and it will re-run tests when files change.

## TypeScript syntax checking

Edit files and run `npm run check` to get the TypeScript compiler to check files without building/running.

## TODO

[x] Simple hashing function to turn a string into an integer
[x] Class for Hashmap that wraps existing JavaScript code that handles Hash Tables
[x] Set of tests for the Hashmap API
[x] Implementing simple Hashmap in own code with fixed size
[ ] Rehashing / changing the size of the Hashmap dynamically
